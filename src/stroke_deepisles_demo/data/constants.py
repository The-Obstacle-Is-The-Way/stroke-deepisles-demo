"""Pre-computed constants for ISLES24 dataset.

The ISLES24 challenge dataset is static (case IDs will never change).
Pre-computing these values avoids:
1. PyArrow streaming bug (apache/arrow#45214) that hangs on parquet iteration
2. Memory issues from downloading the full 99GB dataset

See docs/specs/08-bug-hf-spaces-dataset-loop.md for full investigation.
